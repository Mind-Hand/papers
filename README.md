## Confusionset-guided Pointer Networks for Chinese Spelling Check
* Confusionsets are a lexicon of commonly confused characters.换言之，就是常见的易混淆的字符的集合 
* The clear novelty of our work, however, is the infusion of Confusionsets with Pointer Networks, which help reduce the search space and vastly improve the probability of generating correct characters. 工作明显的创新之处在于将混淆集和指针网络结合，这有助于减少搜索空间并大大提高生成正确字符的概率。
